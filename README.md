My name is Saikrishna, and I received my doctorate from the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, in atmosphere and ocean sciences. I have worked in high-performance computing (HPC) environments for more than four years. I also understand and have analysed the advancements in weather research and forecasting (WRF), and I have used programming languages (Python,NCL) for visualisation to analyse big data sets. 
  -#######################

5+ years’ working experience in High-Performance Computing Environment, Significant knowledge to improvement in seasonal simulations using WRF.
Capability of working with WRF in the sensitivity experiments, Dynamical Downscaling, Spectral nudging and also updating LULC, SST and surface fields.
Simulation of weather extremes (Heavy rainfall events, and Monsoon Depressions.)
Have a 6+ years’ experience Handling and visualisation of large data sets using shell scripting, NCL, and Python programming languages.
Significant working experience with hindcast simulations from Global, seasonal and regional model outputs. 
Gained knowledge in (WRF-3DVAR) assimilating the satellite radiance (INSAT-3D/3DR) for better simulation of extreme rainfall events during summer monsoon. 
Proficient in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel Proficient in downloading and handling the climate data (ex: CMIP5/6)
