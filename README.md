Yes, my dream has come true. I wanted to become a “doctor” and help people, but now I have a “doctorate” and help the country by working on early warning systems for severe weather disasters.

We cannot stop natural disaster, but we can prepare ourselves with knowledge. I am Dr. Siva Saikrishna Tirumani, an Operational Researcher at the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), I specialize in Urban Modeling. My role involves daily monitoring of operational outputs and delivering critical alerts and warnings to local authorities, including municipalities and disaster management agencies.
Earning my Ph.D. has been a life-changing experience, enhanced my problem-solving and analytical skills. It also provided the opportunity to connect with a wide range of researchers, strengthen both personally and professionally.

As a research scholar, I worked on wide range of seasonal prediction models. We have studied the model predictability of the Indian Summer Monsoon and it’s behaviour in the models. I have gained valuable knowledge working with satellite data, hindcast outputs, and significant knowledge in WRF model at seasonal to local-scale.  

At C-DAC, my role helped me to learn about the forecasting weather extremes, and engagement with the subject experts. I have made a setup for operational forecast system for short-range forecast system for the pilot cities of India. Additionally, I have mentored interns from various institutes on weather modeling.

Over the past few years, my journey has been one of continuous learning and development, driving my commitment to improving disaster preparedness and response through advanced research and technology.
